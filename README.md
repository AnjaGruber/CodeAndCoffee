# CodeAndCoffee
The project was implemented using Python language and Jupyter Notebook IDE. The data were taken from the kaggle site, then cleaned and prepared for analysis. After the analysis, a prediction was made which shows how many cups of coffee a person will drink based on gender and number of working hours. In the end, an application was made, where the user enters the gender and number of working hours and gets a prediction of how many cups of coffee that person will drink.
